## Three functions

react-easy-shared-state contains only three functions. Two functions has only one parameters, and one function has no parameters.
That it. If you learn that, you know everything about react-easy-shared-state.

- `newStore` - Usually called once for a project with you initial store.
- `updateStore` - Called after every change to your store, when you wish to rerender automatically the required components.
- `useRenderIfIChange` - Called in every component that needs to be updated based on specific paths in your store

That It! No High-order-components. No Providers, connectors, modifiers, decorations, selectors or other smells.

## Installation

First you have to install react-easy-shared-state

```shell
npm i react-easy-shared-state
```


## Creating your first store

Create the store file `mystore.js` (or `mystore.ts`)

```js
import {newStore} from 'react-easy-shared-state'
const myStore=newStore({
  value:1,
  todos:[]
})
export default myStore
```

The store may contain primitive values, objects, functions, arrays, Dates or whatever you wish. is just a regular javascript object.

:::tip

If you need you can create more than one store

:::

Then you can show values from the store and update or call functions in your store:


```js
import store from './mystore'
function MyComponent(){
  return <div>
    Current value: {store.value}
    <button onClick={()=>{
      store.value++
    }}>Increment</button>
  </div>
}
```

To be sure that your component will render when value changed you have to do 2 things:

- call the function `updateStore` after changing the store.
- Call the function `useRenderIfIChange` and give it an array of values that should be inseted. When of the those values changed, the component will rerender.

import store from './mystore'
function MyComponent(){
  store.useRerenderIfChange(()=>[store.value])
  return <div>
    Current value: {store.value}
    <button onClick={()=>{
      store.value++
      store.updateStore()
    }}>Increment</button>
  </div>
}
```

:::note

That It! Now you know everything about how to use react-easy-shared-state!

## Mutating objects

Another examples of a simple todo list. You don't have to clone the array:

```javascript
import store from './mystore'
function MyComponent(){
  store.useRerenderIfChange(()=>[store.todos])
  return <div>
    {store.todos.map(x=><div>{x}</div>)}
    <button onClick={()=>{
      store.todos.push(new Math.random())
      store.updateStore()
    }}>Add new item</button>
  </div>
}
```

The last thing to know is that you have auto-complete everywhere:

All IDE smart language features like Renaming Symbols, or find all references are working.

## Async operations

What about async operations? It's working out of the box:

```javascript
<button onClick={async ()=>{
  store.isLoading = true
  store.updateStore() // update ajax loaders on the screeen
  let res = await fetch('/getSomethingFromServer')
  store.isloading = false
  store.result=res
  store.updateStore()
}}>Add new item</button>
}
```

## Sharing Logic

If you wish to have a specific logic of mutating to the store (actions), you can add functions to the store and call them:

```js
var store=newStore({
  value:1,
  setValue: newValue=>{
    store.value++
    store.updateStore()
  }
})
```

You can also create async functions.

## Multi stores

Although probably most of the projects will use one global store. You are free to create multi stores, and use each or both of them in any component.

:::tip

You can call updateStore as many time you wish. react-easy-shared-state smart enough to executing it only once per rendering cycle.
